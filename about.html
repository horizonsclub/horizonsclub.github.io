            <h2>About</h2>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Horizons: The Punahou Student Journal was founded in early 2025 by a group of students who recognized a gap in how science was communicated and understood within the school community. Inspired by their own experiences navigating scientific research and writing, they envisioned a platform where students could explore complex topics, improve their communication skills, and share their insights with peers.</p>
            <p>What began as a few conversations between classmates quickly grew into a fully structured initiative, complete with an editorial board, peer review, and a public-facing website. Built entirely by students‚Äîfrom the articles to the codebase‚ÄîHorizons represents a collaborative effort to make science not only accessible, but student-driven.</p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>The purpose of Horizons: The Punahou Student Journal is to foster intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, and scientific communication, by providing a platform for students to publish high-quality topic summaries and case studies across the diverse fields of the biomedical sciences.</p>

            <h3>Our Goals</h3>
            <p>The following are the goals that Horizons sets out to accomplish:</p>
            <p>1. Encourage students to explore scientific topics beyond the classroom.</p>
